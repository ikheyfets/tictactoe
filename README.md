# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is quite straightforward, I created a simple tic-tac-toe game. The original design ran in terminal and relied on a simple function to evaluate the optimal move for an automated opponent. 

The most recent version starts a GUI, powered by Tkinter and your opponent's moves are dictated by a minimax algorithm. 

Enjoy and let me know what you think!
